Project Title: Real-Time Logs Viewer

Description:
The Real-Time Logs Viewer project is a showcase of the implementation of a real-time logs viewing system. This system allows users to monitor and view logs in real-time as they are generated. 

Key Features:
- Real-time updates: The logs viewer continuously fetches and displays logs as they are generated, providing users with up-to-date information.
- Scalability: The system is designed to handle large volumes of logs efficiently, ensuring smooth performance even in high-traffic environments.

Installation and Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Flask server by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ flask --app hello run
    ```
4. In a separate terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute the `append_logs.py` script:
    ```bash
    $ python append_logs.py
    ```
5. Finally, open `index.html` in a web browser to view the real-time logs.
